<h3>Bear Cult</h3>
<p>Bear Cult was inspired by one article in a collection of Joseph Campbell's essays I found in a used book store. It's an introduction to his ideas about the monomyth and the ancient roots of culture. It was written in 1953 (I think) so I don't know how current the ideas are. Anyway, he describes two main branches of prehistoric religion: the bear cult and the cult of the fertility goddess. The fertility cult shows up in agricultural societies, the bear cult among hunter-gatherers. Campbell claims that preserved arrangements of cave bear bones are evidence for the ancient roots of a bear-baiting ritual still practiced by indigenous peoples in Siberia and northern Japan. In the bear-baiting ritual, a young bear is captured, raised in captivity, and then ritually tortured, killed and eaten. The bear is believed to contain the soul of a demigod which yearns to be released from its fleshy bear-prison. For Campbell, the bear cult is the coping mechanism of an animal which kills to survive but suddenly developed empathy for its prey. It's the prehistoric hunter's moral justification for killing: as a kindness and a means of contact with the numinous. The numinous is the sense of awe at contemplation of the infinite. We've all felt it, whether in a church or under the night sky: it's at the root of the religious and scientific impulses. It smells to me an awful lot like the notion of <em>intrinsic motivation</em> in reinforcement learning: a positive feeling obtained by beholding and questioning the world. The deep connection Campbell makes between this most sacred feeling and man's capacity for cruelty is utterly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>I set out to depict the bear-baiting ritual. The body of the bear would be made with paper drawings and cutouts, while the soul would be made with <a href="../video-feedback">virtual video feedback</a>. These material and digital components would interact via flourescent orange paper to be keyed out in adobe aftereffects. An good alternate tile might be "Mind-Body Chromakey". Originally I storyboarded a longer story including human hands and spears piercing the bear and the escape of its soul. Only the first "enter the bear" bit proved feasible for a midterm project. I'm very happy with how the bear soul material turned out. I exported the key as a binary mask and incorporated it in the feedback process, so the roiling cloud-forms corform to the geometry of the bear eyes and nose-hole. On the other hand the black-on-black paper was a terrible idea. I really needed black felt or something for the background. This project also taught me how sound influences the perception of time in film: what felt like a good visual rhythm when I was silently animating seems weirdly abbreviated with the sountrack added. The sound was a bit rushed, but I like the general effect. It's some recordings of bear vocalizations and some carcass-mangling sounds chopped up into phase-rhythms using Max. I would love to revisit this project some day with lessons learned.</p>
