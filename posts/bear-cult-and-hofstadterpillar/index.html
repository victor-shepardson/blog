<h3>Bear Cult</h3>
<p><em>Bear Cult</em> was inspired by a collection of Joseph Campbell's essays I found in a used book store. I was struck by a chapter entitled "Renewal Myths and Rites of the Primitive Hunters and Planters". (It was written in 1960 so I don't know how current the ideas are). It's about the prehistoric (even pre-human) origins of myth. In Campbell's telling, the purpose of myth is to conquer death. Campbell claims that preserved arrangements of cave bear bones are evidence for the ancient roots of a bear-baiting ritual still practiced by indigenous peoples in northern Japan. In the bear-baiting ritual, a young bear is captured, raised in captivity, and then ritually tortured, killed and eaten. The bear is believed to contain the soul of a demigod which yearns to be released from its fleshy bear-prison. For Campbell, this is the coping mechanism of an animal who kills to survive but understands death. It's the hunter's moral justification for killing: death isn't real, killing is a kindness. Ritualized death is a point of contact with the <em>numinous</em>: a sense of awe at contemplation of the infinite at the root of the religious and scientific impulses. I found the deep connection Campbell makes between this most sacred feeling and man's capacity for cruelty heartbreaking. (side note: <em>awe</em> smells to me an awful lot like the notion of <em>intrinsic motivation</em> in reinforcement learning: a positive feeling obtained by beholding and questioning the world; and the numinous smells like an overwhelming double-dose of awe)</p>
<p>I set out to depict a bear-baiting ritual. Not the real, specific practice Campbell describes, but the abstracted elements of a hypothetical prehistoric bear cult. The body of the bear would be made with paper drawings and cutouts, while the soul would be made with <a href="../video-feedback">virtual video feedback</a>. These material and digital components would interact via fluorescent orange paper which would be keyed out in software. An good alternate tile might be "Mind-Body Chromakey". Originally I storyboarded a longer story including human hands and spears piercing the bear and the escape of its soul. Only the first "enter the bear" bit proved feasible for a midterm project. I'm very happy with how the bear soul material turned out. I exported the key as a binary mask and incorporated it in the feedback process, so the roiling cloud-forms conform to the geometry of the bear eyes and nose-hole. On the other hand the black-on-black paper was a terrible idea. I really needed black felt or something for the background. This project also taught me how sound influences the perception of time in film: what felt like a good visual rhythm when I was silently animating seems weirdly abbreviated with the soundtrack added. The sound was a bit rushed, but I like the general effect. It's some recordings of bear vocalizations and some carcass-mangling sounds chopped up into phase-rhythms using Max. I would love to revisit this project some day with lessons learned.</p>
