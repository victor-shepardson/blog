In 2023 I worked on *Pond Brain*, a pair of installations by [Jenna Sutela](https://www.instagram.com/jennasutela/) for Copenhagen Contemporary and the [Helsinki Biennial](https://helsinkibiennaali.fi/en/artist/jenna-sutela/).

I trained real-time neural synthesis models with recordings of marine mammals and water sounds and built them into a feedback ecology with the sounds of musical instruments and stars from the Kepler exoplanet survey. Microphones in the room spun the sounds of visitors into the web of human, whale and celestial body.
