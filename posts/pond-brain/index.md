In 2023 I worked on *Pond Brain*, a pair of installations by [Jenna Sutela](https://www.instagram.com/jennasutela/) for Copenhagen Contemporary and the [Helsinki Biennial](https://helsinkibiennaali.fi/en/artist/jenna-sutela/).

I trained real-time neural synthesis models with recordings of marine mammals and water sounds and built them into a feedback ecology with the sounds of musical instruments and stars in the Kepler exoplanet survey. Microphones in the room and attached to bronze water-singing bowls spun the sounds of visitors into the web of human, whale and celestial body.
