<p>Way back in high school I read Douglas Hofstadter's <a href="https://archive.org/details/GEBen_201404">Gödel, Escher, Bach</a>. If you aren't familiar, I have to advise you to go read it instead of looking at my dumb blog. There are about a hundred captivating ideas in there, and just one of them is the concept of video feedback: connect a video camera to a screen, and then point it at the screen. Weird stuff happens on the screen. (Meanwhile I was learning to play the guitar, and discovering that the electro-acoustic feedback of wiggling the thing around in front of an amp is much more fun than drilling scales.)</p>

<p>As an undergrad, I became interested in computer graphics. (I know of two things that teach you to really see: studying the science of computer graphics, and learning to paint or draw from life.) I was especially taken with the idea of <em>procedural graphics</em>: generating images from nothing but math, as opposed to using assets made by virtually drawing (as in photoshop) or digitizing reality (as with a digital camera). Procedural graphics can translate some of the tantalizing infinites of mathematics into rich sensory experiences! In particular <a href="http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/warp/warp.htm">this brief article</a> by Íñigo Quílez had me enthralled by the idea of turning a random number generator into an endless alien terrain.</p>
<p>Eventually I put two and two together: you can dispense with the video camera and program a completely virtual video feedback process. And once you do, it can do much weirder things than a video camera. This was hardly unknown in computer graphics, yet was weirdly unpopular. There's a preoccupation with statelessness in the scene Quílez is part of; <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">Shadertoy</a> didn't render to texture until 2016! Academic CG tends to focus on predictability and utility for efficient, photorealistic rendering; feedback is unruly and difficult to analyze. Then there are fractals, which are iterated, but not open ended: you iterate to convergence, rather than letting the image evolve as in video feedback. However <a href="http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~chaos/">Jim Crutchfield</a> has written about the dynamics of digital video feedback from a math/physics perspective. 2-D cellular automata like Conway's game of life can be thought of as digital video feedback, and there's a whole <a href="http://golly.sourceforge.net/">hobbyist community</a> there, not to mention the <a href="http://alife.org/">academic artificial life community</a> or <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/">Stephen Wolfram</a>'s insular "new kind of science". The whole field of computational fluid dynamics is doing a similar thing with a different set of priorities! And of course video feedback shows up in fine art beginning (?) with video artists like Nam June Paik.</p>
<p>Finally in the fall of 2014 after encountering such cool dudes as <a href="http://sabrinaratte.com/">Sabrina Ratté</a> and <a href="http://www.alexanderdupuis.com/">Alex Dupuis</a> I was galvanized to get some feedback of my own going. Still blissfully ignorant of much, I started making stuff like this (more recent) doodle:</p>

<p>(Incidentally <a href="https://synesthesia.live/">these folks</a> licensed the above shader to use in their music-reactive visuals software Synesthesia. It looks pretty neat, though I haven't been able to mess with it myself since I don't have a Mac. Maybe take a look if you do.)</p>
<p>Eventually this would grow into such projects as <a href="../abstract-concrete/">ABSTRACT/CONCRETE</a>, <a href="../convnet-video-feedback/">Video Synthesis With Convolutional Autoencoders</a> and <a href="../cortical-sonification">Data Sonification Using a Cortical Representation of Sound</a>.</p>
