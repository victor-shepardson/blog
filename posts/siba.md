In 2014 I spent a lot of time working through a Steve Reich obsession by making tape music. This piece was eventually presented at ICMC 2015. SIBA I|II|III stands for "Studies In Being Alive One Two and Three", which was a joke about the lack of purpose I felt at the time and also a genuine attempt to describe what I was groping toward, stylized to reflect the asemic repetitious sound-destruction therein. I don't know how to feel about it.
