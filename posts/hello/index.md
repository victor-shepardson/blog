For 2017 I resolve to **document more**. I'll be reflecting on old projects here and posting about current ones.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

Things to keep in mind: why am I writing these posts? Who is the audience? As a whole, this blog should give my future self and anyone else an idea of what I've accomplished. Individually, each post should connect some interesting dots for whomever reads it. A good rule of thumb is probably: achine learning people should be able to understand a post about music, and musicians should be able to understand a post about ML. My mom should be able to read any post and get the gist. Writing concise explanations is a real challenge, but a rewarding one! But it's definitely overkill to explain what deep learning is in every related post...I should link to an explainer post or include it as a sidebar, maybe?

I'd like to organize posts by project, and maybe tag them by topic. Right now the site generator is just putting them in most-recently-edited order.

I am dumb and think it's funny to introduce everyone I know personally as a "cool dude". If anyone objects to being referred to this way, please contact me and provide a preferred title!
