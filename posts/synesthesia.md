[Synesthesia](http://synesthesia.live/) is VJ software for making audio-reactive visuals. It draws from the [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) community, where everything is made with GLSL fragment shaders, but includes an easy way to add audio and video inputs and build simple MIDI-mappable control interfaces. Basically, everything a VJ needs to actually perform live with some shaders. The folks building Synesthesia seem super respectful of free-sharing ethos of Shadertoy -- they reached out to shader programmers like me and comissioned new works for Synesthesia, while keeping the actual shaders always hackable by users within the application. I wound up making a few fun video feedback and cellular-automata based scenes, and recently was goaded into using some of them to mess up the live stream from an algorave concert at the AIMC conference:
