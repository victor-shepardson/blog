&lt;h3&gt;Bear Cult&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bear Cult&lt;/em&gt; was inspired by a collection of Joseph Campbell's essays I found in a used book store, specifically one entitled "Renewal Myths and Rites of the Primitive Hunters and Planters". It's about the prehistoric origins of myth. In Campbell's telling, the purpose of myth is to conquer death. Campbell cites preserved arrangements of cave bear bones as evidence for the ancient roots of a bear-baiting ritual still practiced by indigenous peoples in northern Japan. In the bear-baiting ritual, a young bear is captured, raised in captivity, and then ritually tormented, killed and eaten. The bear is believed to contain the soul of a demigod which yearns to be released from its fleshy bear-prison. For Campbell, this is the coping mechanism of an animal which kills to survive but understands death. It's the hunter's moral justification for killing: death isn't terminal, killing is a kindness. Ritualized death is a point of contact with the numinous; the fear of death is transmuted to awe. I found the deep connection Campbell makes between this sacred feeling and human capacity for cruelty heartbreaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to depict a bear-baiting ritual. Not the specific cultural practice Campbell recounts, but the abstracted elements of a hypothetical prehistoric bear cult. The body of the bear would be made by hand with paper drawings and cutouts, while the soul would be made in software with &lt;a href="https://victor-shepardson.github.io/blog/posts/video-feedback"&gt;virtual video feedback&lt;/a&gt;. These material and digital components would interact via fluorescent orange paper which could be keyed out in video editing software. A possible alternate title: "Mind-Body Chromakey". Originally I had storyboarded a longer narrative including human hands and spears piercing the bear and the escape of its soul, but only part proved feasible in the time I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm happy with how the bear soul material turned out. After shooting the paper animation, I exported just the key as a binary mask. As an input to the feedback process, the mask lets the roiling cloud-forms conform to the geometry of the bear eyes and nose-hole. Unfortunately the black-on-black paper was unwise; there's a lot of camera noise after adjusting the levels to make everything visible. A darker background of black felt or something might have worked better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project taught a lesson about how sound influences the perception of time in film. What felt like a good visual rhythm when I was silently animating seems weirdly abbreviated with the soundtrack added. The sound was a bit rushed, but I like the general effect. It's some recordings of bear vocalizations and carcass-mangling sounds chopped up into phase-rhythms with the same methods I used for &lt;a href="https://victor-shepardson.github.io/blog/posts/siba"&gt;SIBA&lt;/a&gt;. I'd like to revisit this project someday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;HOFSTADTERPILLAR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one was my final project for the course. To be continued...&lt;/p&gt;

There are about a hundred captivating ideas in there, and just one of them is the concept of video feedback: connect a video camera to a screen, and then point it at the screen. Weird stuff happens on the screen. Around the same time I was discovering that the audio feedback of wiggling an electric around in front of an amp is more fun than drilling scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an undergrad, I became interested in computer graphics. I was especially taken with the idea of &lt;em&gt;procedural graphics&lt;/em&gt;: generating images from nothing but math, as opposed to using assets made by virtually drawing (as in photoshop) or digitizing reality (as with a digital camera). Procedural graphics can translate some of the tantalizing infinites of mathematics into rich sensory experiences! In particular &lt;a href="http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/warp/warp.htm"&gt;this brief article&lt;/a&gt; by Íñigo Quílez had me enthralled by the idea of turning a random number generator into an endless alien terrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I put two and two together: you can dispense with the video camera and program a completely virtual video feedback process. And once you do, it can do much weirder things than a video camera. This was hardly unknown in computer graphics, yet was weirdly unpopular. There's a preoccupation with statelessness in the scene Quílez is part of; &lt;a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/"&gt;Shadertoy&lt;/a&gt; didn't render to texture until 2016! Academic CG tends to focus on predictability and utility for efficient, photorealistic rendering; feedback is unruly and difficult to analyze. Then there are fractals, which are iterated, but not open ended: you iterate to convergence, rather than letting the image evolve as in video feedback. However &lt;a href="http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~chaos/"&gt;Jim Crutchfield&lt;/a&gt; has written about the dynamics of digital video feedback from a math/physics perspective. 2-D cellular automata like Conway's game of life can be thought of as digital video feedback, and there's a whole &lt;a href="http://golly.sourceforge.net/"&gt;hobbyist community&lt;/a&gt; there, not to mention the &lt;a href="http://alife.org/"&gt;academic artificial life community&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/"&gt;Stephen Wolfram&lt;/a&gt;'s insular "new kind of science". The whole field of computational fluid dynamics is doing a similar thing with a different set of priorities! And of course video feedback shows up in fine art beginning (?) with video artists like Nam June Paik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally in the fall of 2014 after encountering such cool dudes as &lt;a href="http://sabrinaratte.com/"&gt;Sabrina Ratté&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.alexanderdupuis.com/"&gt;Alex Dupuis&lt;/a&gt; I was galvanized to get some feedback of my own going. Still blissfully ignorant of much, I started making stuff like this (more recent) doodle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Incidentally &lt;a href="https://synesthesia.live/"&gt;these folks&lt;/a&gt; licensed the above shader to use in their music-reactive visuals software Synesthesia. It looks pretty neat, though I haven't been able to mess with it myself since I don't have a Mac. Maybe take a look if you do.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually this would grow into such projects as &lt;a href="https://victor-shepardson.github.io/blog/posts/abstract-concrete/"&gt;ABSTRACT/CONCRETE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://victor-shepardson.github.io/blog/posts/convnet-video-feedback/"&gt;Video Synthesis With Convolutional Autoencoders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://victor-shepardson.github.io/blog/posts/cortical-sonification"&gt;Data Sonification Using a Cortical Representation of Sound&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>douglas hofstadter</category><category>feedback</category><category>shadertoy</category><category>visual</category><guid>https://victor-shepardson.github.io/blog/posts/video-feedback/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2017 03:08:22 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
